# StudySyncðŸ–‹

This is the first fully responsive webpage I ever built â€” and itâ€™s special to me! ðŸŽ‰  
I followed Love Babbar sirâ€™s web dev playlist while creating it, and it really helped me understand how HTML and CSS work together to make real websites.  
This was the project where I first started seeing web development differently â€” not just as code, but as something beautiful that people interact with. I was honestly so happy while making this!  

## What I Learned ðŸ§   
- Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML.  
- Styling with modern CSS (variables, media queries, animations).  
- Creating responsive layouts that look great on all screen sizes.  
- Using Google Fonts and SVG icons for a clean design.  
- Adding hover effects and subtle animations for polish.  

## Features ðŸš€  
- Clean and fully responsive design.  
- Smooth animations on sections.  
- Reusable CSS variables for colors and fonts.  
- A company logo grid, feature cards, testimonial cards, and a newsletter section.  
- A well-organized footer with quick links and social media icons.  

## Usage  
Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser â€” everything works offline!
